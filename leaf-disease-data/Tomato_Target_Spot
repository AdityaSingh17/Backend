Symptoms :

1 : On leaves, the disease first appears as small, necrotic lesions with light-brown centers and dark margins.
2 : On fruit, lesions first appear as brown, slightly sunken flecks. As lesions develop, large, pitted areas appear on fruit.
3 : Large deeply sunken lesions, often with visible dark-gray to black fungal growth in the center. 

Treatment :

1 : Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
2 : Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection. 
3 : Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
4 : Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.
