Symptoms : 
1 : Light and dark green mottled areas will appear on the leaves of tomato plants infected with this virus.
2 : Leaves may be curled, malformed, or reduced in size.
3 : Spots of dead leaf tissue may become apparent with certain cultivars at warm temperatures.

Treatment :
1 : Select ToMV-resistant varieties.
2 : Disinfect tools regularly â€” ideally between each plant, as plants can be infected before showing obvious symptoms.
3 : Soaking tools for 1 minute in a 1:9 dilution of germicidal bleach is highly effective.
