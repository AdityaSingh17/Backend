**EXAMPLE TEXT FILE WITH CORRECT FORMAT** 

Symptoms : 
1 : The lesions are dark brown and appear leathery with faint, concentric rings giving a target-spot effect.
2 : At first the spots are small (1 /8 inches in diameter) and oval or angular in shape, but later the spots can enlarge to about 1/2 inches.


Treatment :
1 : Plant only diseasefree, certified seed.
2 : Follow a complete and regular foliar fungicide spray program.                
3 : Allow tubers to mature before digging, dig when vines are dry, not wet, and avoid excessive wounding of potatoes during harvesting and handling.
