Symptoms : 
1 : Feeding injury often gives the top leaf surfaces a mottled or speckled, dull appearance
2 : Leaves then turn yellow and drop. Large populations produce visible webbing that can completely cover the leaves.
3:   Leaves become blotched with pale yellow, reddish brown spots ranging from small to large areas on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Other symptoms caused by either severe or constant attack include distorted leaves, overall loss of plant vigor (in spite of adequate moisture and nutrition), whitening or spotting of leaves, yellowing of the plant or some of the leaves, and in some cases loss of foliage and death


Treatment :
1 : Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops
2 : Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.                
3 : Do not over-fertilize.Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.
