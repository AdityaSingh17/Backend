Symptoms : 
1 : Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing.
2 : The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as 'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth.
3 : Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise).


Treatment :
1 : Select TYLCV-resistant varieties.
2 : Cover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from whitefly infestations.
