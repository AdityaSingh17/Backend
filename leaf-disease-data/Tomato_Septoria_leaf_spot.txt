Symptoms : 
1 : Septoria leaf spots start off somewhat circular and first appear on the undersides of older leaves, at the bottom of the plant.
2 : They are small, 1/16 to 1/8 inches (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters) in diameter, with a dark brown margin and lighter gray or tan centers.
3 : When viewed through a magnifying lens you may see the fruiting bodies of the fungus, which look like dark brown pimples.


Treatment :
1 : Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before working with uninfected plants.
2 : Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease.
