Treatment :
1 : Plant only diseasefree, certified seed.
2 : Check transplants to ensure they are free of late blight before planting.
3 : Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day â€” avoid overhead irrigation.
4 : Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest
