Symptoms : 
1 : On tomato, leaf lesions are initially circular and water-soaked and may be surrounded by a faint yellow halo. In general, spots are dark brown to black and circular on leaves and stems. Spots rarely develop to more than 3 mm in diameter.
2 : Lesions can coalesce causing a blighted appearance of leaves and a general yellowing may occur on leaves with multiple lesions.
3:  Infected leaves may develop a scorched appearance. When spots are numerous, foliage turns yellow and eventually dies, leading to defoliation of the lower portion of the plant.


Treatment :
1 : The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas. Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants- including your own!
2 : In transplant production greenhouses, minimize overwatering and handling of seedlings when they are wet.
