Symptoms :

1 : Affected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out.
2 : Affected leaves appear blistered as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out.
3 : When drying out, leaves turn brown or black in color. When infections are still active,spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like flour.

Treatment :

1: Plant resistant cultivars when available.
2: Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day â€” avoid overhead irrigation.
3: Destroy all potato debris after harvest.
