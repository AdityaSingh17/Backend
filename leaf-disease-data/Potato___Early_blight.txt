Symptoms : 
1 : The early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.
2 : Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.
3 : Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.

Treatment :
1 : Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.
2 : Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
3 : For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.
